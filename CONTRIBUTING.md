## ðŸ§ª Code Style & Practices

- Follow existing patterns (Python / FastAPI / K8s YAML / Markdown)
- Use black + flake8 + isort for Python
- Maintain modularity: 1 component â†’ 1 service
- All external APIs must be observable (add tracing)

- Do not expose endpoints without auth
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configs

---

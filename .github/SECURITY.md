# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep our project secure.

## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it **privately and responsibly**. **Do not open public issues**.

📬 Send your report to: **TO DO**

We aim to respond within **3–5 business days**.

## ✅ Expected Behavior

- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities.
- Do not create public GitHub issues related to security.
- Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and resolve the issue quickly.

## 📦 Supported Versions

We currently support only the **latest version** of the project. As the software matures, we will list supported versions explicitly.

## 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure

We follow a **responsible disclosure** policy. We are committed to fixing vulnerabilities promptly and, if you wish, we’re happy to credit your responsible disclosure.

Thank you for contributing to the security of our open-source project.
